      <h1>Introduction to C Programming</h1>
      <p>
        The C programming language was developed in the early 1970s by <strong>Dennis Ritchie</strong> at
        Bell Labs. It was created as a system programming language for writing operating systems and
        is the foundation of many modern programming languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        C is known for its efficiency, portability, and flexibility. It provides low-level memory
        access, structured programming, and a rich set of built-in functions, making it ideal for
        system-level programming like developing operating systems, compilers, and embedded systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of C's most notable contributions was its use in the development of the UNIX operating
        system, which has had a lasting impact on software development practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding C is crucial for any serious programmer, as it provides the foundation for
        understanding more complex languages like C++, Java, and even Python.
